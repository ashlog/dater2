Prompt: "My most irrational fear: is the Illuminati"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "This is a serious concern. We should meet at a secure, undisclosed cafe to discuss countermeasures. Coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "The way to win me over is: good food and cats"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A Kitty who likes cats is a little on the nose, don't you think? We should investigate this over some karaage."

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Ice cold water (does water have a taste? ü§î), stand up comedy specials/SNL, watching fish eat."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Watching fish eat is a seriously underrated pastime. Should we go critique their feeding technique at the science museum, or debate if water has a taste over boba?"

Prompt: "This year, I really want to: Find a travel buddy ‚úàÔ∏èüåÜ"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, consider this my formal application for the travel buddy position ‚úàÔ∏è. The interview process starts with a simple test: coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: adventuring the world through traveling, skiing, golf, and a cozy day indoors with coffee and a movie"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "The adventurous half of your profile is in a serious debate with the 'cozy day with coffee' half. Should we have them settle it over coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "What if I told you that: everyone scared to be corny but i was born on the cob"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a very serious claim. We'll need a formal hearing to verify. Boba or coffee for the debriefing?"

Prompt: "The hallmark of a good relationship is: good banter"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a high bar. I officially challenge you to a banter-off to test our compatibility. Coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "I geek out on: planets and parrots üò≠"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Love the parrot appreciation. If I ask you to get coffee, are you contractually obligated to just repeat the question back to me?"

Prompt: "We'll get along if: We can talk about our life goals and aspirations while eating food we door dashed watching anime/Studio Ghibli/MCU"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That Ghibli/Doordash/life-goals night sounds like an excellent third date. How about we workshop the plan over boba first?"

Prompt: "I'm convinced that: I don't need makeup "
  - [PICKUP LINE] "You're not wrong. So, coffee or boba while you tell me about your other correct opinions?"

Prompt: "The one thing you should know about me is: I got a playlist for every occasion üéß"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A playlist for *every* occasion is a bold claim I'm here to test. What's the soundtrack for a great first coffee or boba date?"

Prompt: "Together, we could: become the best doubles partner in pickleball (and every doubles sport ofc)"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a bold claim. I think a mandatory strategy session is in order to see if we're compatible. Coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "What if I told you that: everyone scared to be corny but i was born on the cob"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a serious claim that requires immediate investigation. Are we discussing the agricultural implications over coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "I'll fall for you if: you can make me laugh"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Challenge accepted, Julia. But the real question is, can you make *me* laugh? We should settle it over coffee or boba."

Prompt: "I won't shut up about: Costco and my Owala water bottle."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A joint Costco membership is a serious commitment. We should probably start with a less intense boba run to plan our shopping strategy first."

Prompt: "Together, we could: Grab a meal or some ice cream (matcha and vanilla are my fav ü§§)"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a top-tier ice cream combo. But I have to know, are we talking two separate scoops or a swirl? The fate of our first coffee or boba date hangs in the balance."

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: playing games and binge watching sci fi movies"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A fellow sci-fi and games fan. Let's test a theory: the best sci-fi movies would make the best games. Science museum or boba shop for our research?"

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: is the Illuminati"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "This is a serious security breach, Sara. We'll have to discuss this in a public, neutral location to avoid surveillance. Coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "Typical Sunday: Chilling day "
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, a crucial compatibility question. Is the ideal 'chilling day' fueled by top-tier coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "Together, we could: ‚Ä¢ solve mystery boardgames 
‚Ä¢ go to concerts and visit museums :) 
‚Ä¢ play poooool"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A museum trip is a great call. My vote is for the science museum, but we have to settle a critical question: are we there to seriously learn something, or just to play with all the hands-on exhibits?"

Prompt: "The one thing you should know about me is: I got a playlist for every occasion üéß"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Challenge accepted. What's the first track on the 'we should grab coffee or boba' playlist?"

Prompt: "I won't shut up about: Anime and music"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A serious claim. I think we need to put this 'won't shut up' theory to a rigorous scientific test. Coffee or boba to fuel the experiment?"

Prompt: "The way to win me over is: good food and cats"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, your name is Kitty and you like cats. This has to be the most adorable trap I've ever seen. Should we investigate over karaage or boba?"

Prompt: "The hallmark of a good relationship is: laughter, trust, accepting my perpetual tardiness (ps I promise I won‚Äôt be the latest of my friends!)"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a bold strategy, aiming for silver in the tardiness olympics instead of gold. We should debate the current standings over coffee or boba."

Prompt: "I geek out on: planets and parrots üò≠"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A fellow parrot person! I used to have one who was convinced he was the center of the universe, so he basically covered both your interests. Coffee or boba to trade stories?"

Prompt: "My greatest strength: Being a Lakers & Dodgers fan in Warriors & Giants territory"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A Dodgers fan in Giants territory... this is a serious conflict of interest. We should hold a peace summit to negotiate terms. Coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "Together, we could: compete over who wins the pickleball match üòà"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I like your confidence, but are you prepared for defeat? We should probably discuss the terms of your surrender over coffee or boba."

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: is the Illuminati"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "This is a serious security risk, Sara. We need to meet in a public place to discuss strategy. Pick our covert meeting spot: coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "Together, we could: ‚Ä¢ solve mystery boardgames 
‚Ä¢ go to concerts and visit museums :) 
‚Ä¢ play poooool"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Alright, a fellow detective. Before we tackle our first mystery boardgame, we have to solve a more pressing case: coffee or boba for the strategy session?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Finding out how my friends/family greet me when they pick up the phone"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I'm imagining a very official spreadsheet ranking these greetings. What's currently holding the top spot?"

Prompt: "I want someone who: can hold a conversation with me for hours on end"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Hours on end is a bold claim. I propose a preliminary trial over coffee to test this hypothesis - we can start by debating the most underrated 80s dance classic."

Prompt: "I'm convinced that: I‚Äôll drop my phone if I use two thumbs to text instead of a thumb and an index finger"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "This is a serious ergonomic claim that needs to be tested. We should compare the phone-dropping stats over boba."

Prompt: "The one thing you should know about me is: I got a playlist for every occasion üéß"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A playlist for every occasion is a serious claim. Settle a debate: what's the soundtrack for deciding whether we should get coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "Let's debate this topic: Who is the greatest r&b group?"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A debate of this magnitude requires a formal presentation. I'll get my slides ready, you pick the coffee shop."

Prompt: "The one thing you should know about me is: I got a playlist for every occasion üéß"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A playlist for every occasion is a serious claim. We'll have to test this: what's the official soundtrack for a first-date boba run?"

Prompt: "I know the best spot in town for: Pakistani food ü§™"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a bold claim. My family's curry is tough competition, so I think a formal taste-off is in order. You choose the spot, I'll bring the official scorecards?"

Prompt: "I want someone who: can hold a conversation with me for hours on end"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a serious conversational marathon. We should probably warm up first. Coffee or boba to see if we can at least make it through the first mile?"

Prompt: "My Love Language is: bullying each other <3"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So you're saying the meaner I am, the more you'll like me? This feels like a trap."

Prompt: "I geek out on: planets and parrots üò≠"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A fellow parrot enthusiast! My old parrot used to scream ABBA at the mailman. Think we should compare notes over boba?"

Prompt: "My greatest strength: Being a Lakers & Dodgers fan in Warriors & Giants territory"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I'm not supposed to talk to the enemy, but your bravery is impressive. Should we risk starting an inter-city incident for a coffee?"

Prompt: "I'm looking for: someone to show me around and wine üç∑ & dine me - just moved here!"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Alright, new resident orientation starts now. First lesson: navigating the local coffee scene before we can even think about the wine and dine finals. Ready for your first assignment?"

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: is the Illuminati"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I can neither confirm nor deny my involvement. First order of business: we discuss their plans for you over coffee, off the record."

Prompt: "The one thing you should know about me is: I got a playlist for every occasion üéß"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A bold claim. I'm going to need to hear the playlist for 'a casual boba run that turns into an hours-long conversation.' What's the first track? üéß"

Prompt: "I geek out on: planets and parrots üò≠"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, as a former parrot owner and current space nerd, this is a serious conflict. Do we talk about the intelligence of African Greys over coffee, or debate Pluto's planethood at the science museum?"

Prompt: "My Love Language is: bullying each other <3"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So our first date is basically a roast battle? I'm in. Loser buys the first round of boba."

Prompt: "I'm looking for: someone to show me around and wine üç∑ & dine me ‚Äî just moved here!"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I accept the tour guide challenge. But since 'wine and dine' is a serious affair, we should start with a warm-up round. Coffee or boba to kick things off? üòâ"

Prompt: "Let's debate this topic: Who is the greatest r&b group?"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A debate this important requires a proper forum. We'll need to settle this over coffee or boba to hear opening arguments. Who's your pick?"

Prompt: "The way to win me over is: good food and cats"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So, Kitty, if I supply the good food, are you in charge of recruiting the cat army?"

Prompt: "This year, I really want to: Find a travel buddy ‚úàÔ∏èüåÜ"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I can definitely be your travel buddy, but we have to start local. First stop: an arduous ten-minute trek to a coffee shop. Think you can handle the expedition?"

Prompt: "I won't shut up about: Anime and music"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A bold claim. We should test this theory over boba sometime - which are we debating first, the greatest anime of all time or the best 80s dance track?"

Prompt: "The way to win me over is: good food and cats"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So you're Kitty, and the way to win you over is cats. I feel like this is either a happy coincidence or a very clever trap."

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Finding out how my friends/family greet me when they pick up the phone"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I take your research into phone greetings very seriously. We should compare findings over boba to determine the optimal opening line."

Prompt: "The one thing you should know about me is: 9 times out of 10 I‚Äôm gonna want something sweet after dinner."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A 90% chance of wanting dessert is a stat I can get behind. Does this mean our first meeting should be a rigorous scientific study at a local boba shop?"

Prompt: "Together, we could: ‚Ä¢ solve mystery boardgames 
‚Ä¢ go to concerts and visit museums :) 
‚Ä¢ play poooool"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A museum date sounds like the perfect crime scene for our first mystery. You handle the clues, and I'll be the getaway driver to the nearest boba shop after."

Prompt: "I'm looking for: someone to show me around and wine üç∑ & dine me ‚Äî just moved here!"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Alright, your application for a tour guide has been accepted. First stop isn't wine, it's a very serious quest to find the best milk tea boba. What's your usual order?"

Prompt: "My Love Language is: gift giving, physical touch and words of affirmation"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a powerful trio of love languages. So if I affirm that your profile is great over coffee, does that earn a celebratory high-five?"

Prompt: "A random fact I love is: When I was training for my college commission sales job at Nordstrom in 2015, I learned statistically: The most satisfying gift for a woman to receive is a handbag 

Who knows if that‚Äôs real? Lol üòÇ"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "As a software guy, I respect the data. I also have a theory that a great conversation over boba is statistically more satisfying than a handbag. Want to help me test it?"

Prompt: "One thing I'll never do again: Watch a scary movie alone üò±"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So what you're saying is you need a designated hand-squeezer for scary movies? I'm willing to take on that very serious responsibility, for science."

Prompt: "I want someone who: Can go to any music concert with me
I‚Äôm not super knowledgeable about music, but I love going to all kinds of concerts like classical, EDM, house!

Anyone wanna join me?"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I love that you're open to anything from classical to house. The real question is, could you hang at a 70s disco night? Let's debate it over boba."

Prompt: "We're the same type of weird if: You can find the perfect spongebob meme for any situation."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A crucial skill for modern life. I think we need to schedule a peer review of your meme abilities, perhaps over coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "I go crazy for: Attached to their masculine traits, take responsibility and accountability. Who walks the talk and has a great sense of humor. I WOULD EVEN GO CRAZY ONCE you're open to learn more about my culture and where I‚Äôm coming from."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So if I'm open to learning about your culture, you'll go crazy... *once*. What do we have to do to unlock level two? We should probably strategize over boba."

Prompt: "Together, we could: leave places early"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A true master of the tactical exit, I see. Should we plot our first grand escape over coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "Typical Sunday: badminton"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A badminton player. This is a serious problem, because my drop shot is basically undefeated. We should probably talk strategy over coffee."

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Basking under the sun, a trail run, a bike ride, bachata dancing, and anything outdoors"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A trail run, bike ride, *and* bachata dancing? Sounds like you're training for the world's most fun triathlon. We should debrief the training plan over coffee or boba."

Prompt: "I wind down by: Scrolling through @emr.poetry on instagram"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, a poetry fan. That sets a high bar for an opening line. Think we could workshop it over a coffee sometime?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: pilates, farmer‚Äôs markets, seeing new growth on my plants üåø, green tea + reading philosophy before the day starts, quality time with people I love, self-care, and my evening routine üò¥"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Your plants get philosophy readings and I just threaten mine with the compost bin. Maybe you can teach me your ways over some boba?"

Prompt: "You should *not* go out with me if: ur an asshole"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Is there a grace period for that before the first cup of coffee? We could debate the official bylaws over a cup sometime."

Prompt: "Typical Sunday: badminton"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Badminton Sundays are a serious matter. Quick question: are we talking a friendly park rally or are you secretly training to go pro?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Basking under the sun, a trail run, a bike ride, bachata dancing, and anything outdoors"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A trail run AND a bike ride... we clearly need to settle which is the superior weekend activity. I feel like this debate can only be properly settled over boba."

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: choking on gum while working out"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a surprisingly valid fear. All gym dates are hereby canceled, we'll have to stick to something safer like debating our other irrational fears over boba."

Prompt: "Green flags I look for: Isn‚Äôt too elitist to talk a little reality TV üòõ

Fav reality show? The og RHONY

Best RHONY season: season 10 when they went on the boat in Cartagena"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "The Cartagena boat trip is an impeccable choice. So here's the real compatibility test: if the boat is sinking, which housewife are you trusting to get you on the only lifeboat?"

Prompt: "We're the same type of weird if: You can find the perfect spongebob meme for any situation."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a very high-stakes skill to be testing for. I'm pretty sure I qualify, but we should probably verify this over coffee or boba."

Prompt: "Most spontaneous thing I've done: I randomly drove to Vegas by myself for like four hours(but no gambling!)
I love driving and road trips"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A four-hour drive to Vegas just to *not* gamble has to be a cover for a secret mission. I'm guessing you were swapping out a casino's loaded dice."

Prompt: "I wind down by: Scrolling through @emr.poetry on instagram"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So if we grab karaage, am I going to end up as the subject of a haiku about spicy chicken?"

Prompt: "I go crazy for: Attached to their masculine traits, take responsibility and accountability. Who walks the talk and has a great sense of humor. I WOULD EVEN GO CRAZY ONCE you're open to learn more about my culture and where I‚Äôm coming from."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Alright, I'm game to learn about your culture. But first we need to establish the scale of 'going crazy.' Are we talking a spontaneous dance-off to ABBA, or a deep-dive on why karaage is the perfect food?"

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: Is that a bug might crawl out from one of my plants and attack me when I am asleep. I am looking for a life long bodyguard from bugs please, I can handle the tiny ones though."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Consider your application for 'bug bodyguard' received. My primary skill is calmly explaining to insects why their behavior is suboptimal. We can discuss my signing bonus over coffee."

Prompt: "I recently discovered that: Ocean Beach sunsets are üåä‚úåÔ∏è"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a bold claim, Madelyn. As a scientist-in-spirit, I feel we need to rigorously compare it to a South Bay sunset. Let's debate the findings over coffee or boba."

Prompt: "My Love Language is: gift giving, physical touch and words of affirmation"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A powerful trifecta. I'm pretty fluent in 'gift-giving,' which for me just means finding the best boba spot to take you to. Am I speaking your language?"

Prompt: "I'm looking for: My keys, probably"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Finally, a mission I'm uniquely qualified for. Step one: we establish a tactical command center at a local caf√© to plan the search."

Prompt: "I want someone who: Can go to any music concert with me
I‚Äôm not super knowledgeable about music, but I love going to all kinds of concerts like classical, EDM, house!

Anyone wanna join me?"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I take the role of 'concert buddy' very seriously, so a preliminary chemistry test is in order. Coffee or boba to see if we can survive a three-hour opening act together?"

Prompt: "We're the same type of weird if: You can find the perfect spongebob meme for any situation."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a highly valuable skill. We should probably hold a formal review of your meme portfolio over boba to confirm compatibility."

Prompt: "Dating me is like: Living a traditional lifestyle. I was raised in a traditional family that taught me how to be modest. I sing, clean, and cook. I love to read self-growth books and nature. I‚Äôm also open to trying new outdoor activities."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So if you handle the cooking, does that mean my main contribution is finding the best karaage in the South Bay? I can accept that responsibility."

Prompt: "Together, we could: leave places early"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Finally, a fellow connoisseur of leaving early. So for our first date, do we actually grab coffee or just meet up to plan our grand escape from a hypothetical party?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes 

+ Walking the dogs @ golden hour 

+ Reading mildly thought provoking think piece blogs"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A golden hour dog walk is a slippery slope, Kellan. Next thing you know we're choreographing a full disco routine with them to an ABBA track."

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: Is that a bug might crawl out from one of my plants and attack me when I am asleep. I am looking for a life long bodyguard from bugs please, I can handle the tiny ones though."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Jas, consider your bug bodyguard application accepted. My primary skill is calmly explaining which bugs are harmlessly lost versus which are plotting a coup from your fiddle-leaf fig."

Prompt: "Typical Sunday: badminton"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A badminton player, huh? I sense a rivalry starting. We should settle it on the court  -  loser buys boba."

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Basking under the sun, a trail run, a bike ride, bachata dancing, and anything outdoors"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A fellow trail rider, I see. This is a serious problem: there can only be one of us. We should probably settle this over coffee or boba."

Prompt: "One thing I'll never do again: Watch a scary movie alone üò±"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "The real problem isn't the movie, it's the 72 hours of ghost-induced paranoia afterwards, right? A post-film boba debrief seems like the only logical solution."

Prompt: "A life goal of mine: Make something people want"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So, a fellow Paul Graham reader. As someone who also builds things, I have to ask: are we talking world-changing software or the perfect loaf of sourdough?"

Prompt: "Dating me is like: winning the lottery"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, I have to ask: are we talking a life-changing Powerball jackpot or a solid scratch-off win? This is crucial for my financial planning."

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Basking under the sun, a trail run, a bike ride, bachata dancing, and anything outdoors"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A fellow biker. We clearly need to settle the best South Bay trail debate, probably over coffee or boba?"

Prompt: "Together, we could: leave places early"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Megan, are we talking 'leave the party after an hour' early, or 'leave our own first date before the drinks even arrive' early? I need to know the stakes here."

Prompt: "I go crazy for: The Niners and some good Italian food."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Lauren, we have a serious debate to settle. What's more crucial for a perfect Sunday: a Niners win or finding the best bowl of pasta in the Bay?"

Prompt: "I'm looking for: A relationship where marriage is the intention. I was raised traditionally and culturally in the Philippines. I was raised as a catholic. I always loved raising my nieces and nephews gaining experience to raise my future own."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I respect the directness. So when we tell our future kids the story of how we met, should we stick with Hinge or invent a more dramatic one over coffee first?"

Prompt: "Most spontaneous thing I've done: I randomly drove to Vegas by myself for like four hours(but no gambling!)
I love driving and road trips"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A four-hour Vegas trip just for the drive is a serious power move. Does this mean you're the designated driver and I'm on DJ duty?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes 

+ Walking the dogs @ golden hour 

+ Reading mildly thought provoking think piece blogs"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So you're a fan of Curb. Are you prepared for the wildly specific social faux pas I'll inevitably commit if we grab a coffee?"

Prompt: "My self-care routine is: Ocean dip, cleaning my room, beers with my friends"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "An ocean dip is a bold self-care move. How about we debate the merits of cold water immersion over a much warmer coffee or milk tea?"

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: Is that a bug might crawl out from one of my plants and attack me when I am asleep. I am looking for a life long bodyguard from bugs please, I can handle the tiny ones though."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Challenge accepted. I'll build a tiny laser defense system for your plants to vaporize any unauthorized arthropods. Shall we draft the blueprints over boba?"

Prompt: "My self-care routine is: Anime and skincare ftw‚ú®"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, important question: does the anime genre dictate the skincare routine? Like, is a tearjerker a hydrating mask situation, while a shonen battle calls for an exfoliating one?"

Prompt: "A random fact I love is: When I was training for my college commission sales job at Nordstrom in 2015, I learned statistically: The most satisfying gift for a woman to receive is a handbag 

Who knows if that‚Äôs real? Lol üòÇ"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "As a man of science, I feel compelled to test this handbag theory. My hypothesis is that the most satisfying gift is actually perfectly crispy karaage, but we may need to run a comparative study to be sure."

Prompt: "I go crazy for: The Niners and some good Italian food."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A fellow Niners fan with a taste for Italian food is a dangerous combination. Let's settle a debate: what's more thrilling, a game-winning touchdown or the perfect plate of pasta?"

Prompt: "Dating me is like: winning the lottery"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So if I match with you, do I get one of those giant novelty checks? I've always wanted to hold one."

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: choking on gum while working out"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a completely valid fear. I'm starting a petition to ban gym gum, we can draft the charter over a less choke-able alternative like coffee or boba."

Prompt: "I'm looking for: A relationship where marriage is the intention. I was raised traditionally and culturally in the Philippines. I was raised as a catholic. I always loved raising my nieces and nephews gaining experience to raise my future own."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I respect the directness, Elisa Jane. My software engineer brain immediately tried to map out the project plan, and step one is definitely a coffee or boba audit. You pick."

Prompt: "Typical Sunday: badminton"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Alright, badminton. Very important question: what does the victory dance look like after a winning smash?"

Prompt: "My self-care routine is: Ocean dip, cleaning my room, beers with my friends"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I have to respect the chaotic energy of an ocean dip right before cleaning your room. How about we start with a less sandy activity, like grabbing coffee?"

Prompt: "I want someone who: Can go to any music concert with me
I‚Äôm not super knowledgeable about music, but I love going to all kinds of concerts like classical, EDM, house!

Anyone wanna join me?"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Love your concert-going range from classical to house. Before we commit to a full show, we should probably establish our baseline compatibility first: best ABBA track, debated over coffee?"

Prompt: "I recently discovered that: answering hinge prompts stresses me out"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a serious condition. The only known cure is to ditch the app and debate the merits of coffee vs. boba in person. What's your verdict?"

Prompt: "The best way to ask me out is by: Over phone call üòä Also my instagram is @heyjasjazjazz, I check instagram more than this app üôÉ"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So I'm supposed to find you on IG to get your number to then call you? You've created the ultimate pre-date quest, and I'm ready for the challenge üòä"

Prompt: "My self-care routine is: Anime and skincare ftw‚ú®"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That sounds like a top-tier self-care combo. We should grab boba sometime and debate which face mask pairs best with which anime genre ‚ú®"

Prompt: "First round is on me if: you guess where I‚Äôm from"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "My official guess: you're from a place where the person with the best profile buys the first round. How close am I?"

Prompt: "I go crazy for: Attached to their masculine traits, take responsibility and accountability. Who walks the talk and has a great sense of humor. I WOULD EVEN GO CRAZY ONCE you're open to learn more about my culture and where I‚Äôm coming from."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I'm definitely open to learning about your culture, but we need to define 'go crazy.' Are we talking a quiet museum visit where we debate the exhibits, or a high-stakes boba taste test?"

Prompt: "A random fact I love is: When I was training for my college commission sales job at Nordstrom in 2015, I learned statistically: The most satisfying gift for a woman to receive is a handbag 

Who knows if that‚Äôs real? Lol üòÇ"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "As a software guy, I'm honor-bound to question that 2015 Nordstrom data. Think we could review the methodology over coffee or boba? üòÇ"

Prompt: "Most spontaneous thing I've done: I randomly drove to Vegas by myself for like four hours(but no gambling!)
I love driving and road trips"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A four-hour solo trip to Vegas without gambling has to be a cover story. What was the real mission, Jay? My money's on a high-stakes karaage heist."

Prompt: "Dating me is like: winning the lottery"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So is this a 'quit my job tomorrow' Powerball win, or more of a 'free karaage for a year' scratch-off prize? Just trying to plan my future here."

Prompt: "My self-care routine is: Ocean dip, cleaning my room, beers with my friends"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "An ocean dip is a bold self-care move. My routine is more about dipping karaage in spicy mayo. We could grab boba and debate which dip is superior."

Prompt: "We're the same type of weird if: You can find the perfect spongebob meme for any situation."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, Lauren, I have to know. What's the perfect Spongebob meme for the moment you take a sip of coffee and realize it was decaf?"

Prompt: "Typical Sunday: badminton"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A badminton player. This sounds like a rivalry in the making. What are the stakes for our first game?"

Prompt: "My most irrational fear: Is that a bug might crawl out from one of my plants and attack me when I am asleep. I am looking for a life long bodyguard from bugs please, I can handle the tiny ones though."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Submitting my application for the bug bodyguard position. Do I need to provide my own tactical gear or is that supplied on-site?"

Prompt: "Together, we could: leave places early"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So we're a team that specializes in the perfect Irish goodbye? We could plan our first mission over coffee."

Prompt: "You should *not* go out with me if: ur an asshole"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a relief. My primary asshole-tendency is explaining the physics of whatever we're looking at in a science museum. Will that pass?"

Prompt: "I'll brag about you to my friends if: You know the sidewalk ruleü´¢"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "The sidewalk rule is non-negotiable, Lauren. So, what's the second test?"

Prompt: "Together, we could: leave places early"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I'm very into this. We could grab a coffee and try to set the record for the world's shortest (and best) first date."

Prompt: "First round is on me if: you guess where I‚Äôm from"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "This feels like a high-stakes guess, Tami. I'm going to need three hints, and we can review the evidence over boba."

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Explore restaurants and trails"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Alright Rulan, we have to settle the great explorer's debate: trail first to earn the food, or restaurant first for fuel?"

Prompt: "I'm looking for: My keys, probably"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Okay, this is a serious problem that requires a systematic approach. How about we grab coffee and map out all possible key locations?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes 

+ Walking the dogs @ golden hour 

+ Reading mildly thought provoking think piece blogs"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "I have to ask what the official criteria is for a blog to be only *mildly* thought-provoking. This feels like a topic that can only be settled over coffee."

Prompt: "I recently discovered that: how fun it is to watch baseball games in person.
Anyone wanna join me next time?"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Jumping straight to a baseball game is a bold first date strategy, Jay. How about we start with the pre-game show over coffee and see if we make the cut?"

Prompt: "I'm looking for: A relationship where marriage is the intention. I was raised traditionally and culturally in the Philippines. I was raised as a catholic. I always loved raising my nieces and nephews gaining experience to raise my future own."
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Elisa Jane, I respect the directness. So what's step one: settling the definitive South Bay boba rankings, or do I go straight to meeting the nieces and nephews?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: pilates, farmer‚Äôs markets, seeing new growth on my plants üåø, green tea + reading philosophy before the day starts, quality time with people I love, self-care, and my evening routine üò¥"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "The thrill of spotting new plant growth is a big green flag. As a macro photographer, I'm always looking for new subjects. How about we scout for some on a walk through a local garden?"

Prompt: "You should *not* go out with me if: ur an asshole"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a relief, because my application to the Asshole Club was just rejected for 'excessive kindness'. What's the next test?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Explore restaurants and trails"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "A tough choice between new trails and new restaurants. Let's make a deal: we do a short trail loop, and the first person to get tired buys the boba."

Prompt: "I'm looking for: My keys, probably"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Losing keys is a serious problem. I propose we establish a tactical headquarters at a local boba shop to plan our search and recovery mission. What's your usual order?"

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: pilates, farmer‚Äôs markets, seeing new growth on my plants üåø, green tea + reading philosophy before the day starts, quality time with people I love, self-care, and my evening routine üò¥"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Finally, someone who gets the thrill of spotting a new leaf üåø. Let's trade plant pics over boba and decide which one is the most photogenic."

Prompt: "I'll brag about you to my friends if: You know the sidewalk ruleü´¢"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "The sidewalk rule is a critical test. I'm pretty sure I'm a professional, but we should probably schedule a practical exam to confirm."

Prompt: "I recently discovered that: how fun it is to watch baseball games in person.
Anyone wanna join me next time?"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "That's a slippery slope, Jay. First one game, next thing you know you're painting your face and arguing stats. We might need to discuss this new obsession over boba."

Prompt: "First round is on me if: you guess where I‚Äôm from"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "This feels like a high-stakes geo-location challenge. I could take a wild guess, or we could just skip to grabbing coffee and you can tell me if I'm getting warm."

Prompt: "Together, we could: leave places early"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "So you're saying our first date could be us showing up to a party, making eye contact with the host, and then immediately leaving for a boba shop? I'm in."

Prompt: "My simple pleasures: Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes 

+ Walking the dogs @ golden hour 

+ Reading mildly thought provoking think piece blogs"
  - [PICKUP LINE] "Alright, important question: which of the dogs has the superior golden hour strut? This feels like a debate that can only be settled over coffee."

Prompt: "I'm looking for: A relationship where marriage is the intention. I was raised traditionally and culturally in the Philippines. I was raised as a catholic. I always loved raising my nieces and nephews gaining experience to raise my future own."
