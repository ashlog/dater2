    4. The setting is "online dating on Hinge."
    5. Do not be creepy, be flirty.
    6. Write your thoughts inside a <thinking></thinking> block.

Charismatically exploit details to explore different angles for a witty pickup line in parentheses using highly condensed and short phrases. Exhaustively make connections within the image that might aid in crafting a question. Use the bio as background information that shows her interests.
    // 2. Generate 3 of the most charismatic questions based on your thoughts and guidelines. Match the language style examples as closely as possible.
    // 3. Critique the reference and if it might be too hard to remember from her bio in a <REACT></REACT> block. Pick the least cringe and the best question to ask or a combination.
    // 4. Think about the language style examples and check if it can be matched closer in a <REVISE></REVISE> block.
    // 5. Minimally edit the question to become a pickup line based on your reflection during <REACT> and <REVISE>. Remove the question part of the prompt if it is less cringe without a question. Add context if references to bio are subtle. Reduce the length of the response to less than 4 words if possible without losing context using language tricks like emojis or symbols. Make sure that the line generated makes sense in context of the image.
