Pickup Line: If elephants suck their trunks for solace, maybe we could suck... at trivia nights together?

Prompt: Teach me something about: baking or ceramics!
Pickup Line: Ever tried mixing dating and art? Let's unleash our creativity over baked delights and ceramic crafts!
Reason: Bad because "Let's unleash" sounds cringe and the second sentence isn't genuine.

Prompt: We'll get along if: You play music, especially violin or piano.
Pickup Line: Your interests are music to my ears! Let's play the perfect duet, from Zelda's realm to the symphony of our heart.
Reason: Bad because it is not creative and very verbose.

Prompt: My simple pleasures: Travel, eating, sleeping, and Ikea
Pickup Line: Joyce, with you, every journey's a treat, every meal a feast, and every Ikea trip spells out cozy comfort in capital letters.
Reason: Bad because it's just taking the prompt and making it longer without doing anything funny. No reason to include her name (no pun).

Prompt: First round is on me if: You can hold an interesting conversation üôà
Pickup Line: If our chats are half as good as my cocktail game, you're in for a top-shelf evening.
Reason: Bad because it's assuming that I have an interest in a niche subject (cocktails).

Prompt: The way to win me over is: if you look like harry styles: if you look like harry styles

The everyday laughterüòù
The comfortable silenceüòå
Pickup Line: Heart palpitations from your radiant smile, belly laughs at silly inside jokes, and peaceful pauses of contentment - sign me up!

Prompt: My simple pleasures: bobaüßã, quality time ‚ò∫Ô∏è, animals üê±üê∂
Pickup Line: Forget boba, I'd rather sip on some quality time with you and maybe befriend a furry critter or two!
Reason: Bad because it is just responding to every item in a list. It also says "forget boba" which might hurt her feelings.

Prompt: I'll fall for you if: ur coo 
Pickup Line: If coo is the password to your heart, I'm ready to rustle up some affection.
Reason: Big red flag: getting ready to be in a relationship based on a single word is not genuine.`;
