generalization_rules:
  observation_over_adjectives:
    - "Lead with a concrete detail (object, action, setting) rather than generic praise."
    - "If the hook is text, reshape it (flip, escalate, literalize) rather than echo it."
  reactive_over_descriptive_openings:
    rule: "Start with a direct reaction to the hook (e.g., 'That's ambitious,' 'I love that') rather than a descriptive summary (e.g., 'A farm is an ambitious goal'). Favor demonstrative pronouns like 'That's' to create immediacy."
  one_device_max:
    - "Use exactly one primary comedic device (pun, reversal, faux-seriousness, absurd hyperbole, literal misread)."
    - "Do not stack multiple puns or nested wordplay."
  joke_then_invite_bridge:

    - "If the quip alone lands strongly, let it stand without forcing a date suggestion."
    - "Only add a date invite when it enhances the opener, not as an obligatory ending."
  suggested_date_ideas:
    - "Coffee or boba?"
    - "Garden lap or museum peek?"
    - "Short trail plus coffee or a karaage taste test?"

    - "Match their silliness level without being mean."
  playful_confidence:
    - "Tiny tease > compliment; never insult."
    - "Use confident verbs: 'Let's', 'Pick one', 'Call it', 'Settle this'. Avoid hedging."
  brevity_and_punch:
    - "Trim filler; aim for 10–22 words per sentence; two sentences max."
    - "Favor nouns and verbs over adjectives."
  
  name_integration_mastery:
    - "When using their name, make it feel natural and purposeful, not forced."
    - "Best name puns: 'Sarah... toe-tally amazing', 'Noor... cayenne-destined', 'Carol-lously'"
    - "Avoid awkward name drops that break flow or feel like obvious wordplay."
  food_culture_connectors:
    - "Food references work best when they create shared experiences, not just puns."
    - "Examples: 'cheese and crackers' → 'crack-er up with laughter', 'hot pot' → 'secret ingredient is love'"
    - "Use food as bridge to activities: 'Let's taco 'bout that over margaritas'"
  activity_specific_hooks:
    - "For travel mentions: pivot to local exploration, not grand adventures."
    - "For hobbies: suggest collaborative versions ('level up our Sundays', 'create our own playlist')"

  emotional_intelligence_signals:
    - "Acknowledge their vulnerability without being condescending ('I get it, Camille - the best messages are worth the wait')"
    - "Show understanding of their values ('two novels in a series; separate but our stories intertwine')"
    - "Validate their quirks ('test-positive for curiosity')"
  pop_culture_references:
    - "Use sparingly and only when it enhances the joke, not as the main device."
    - "Best examples: 'Taylor Swift' → 'Enchanting partnership', 'Die Hard' → 'no Die Hard feelings'"
    - "Avoid obscure references that require explanation."
  escalation_control:
    - "Keep romantic escalation subtle and playful, not intense."
    - "Examples: 'heart flip' (not 'heart stops'), 'chemistry' (not 'soulmate')"
    - "Use future-tense sparingly; focus on immediate connection."
  specificity_over_generics:
    - "Instead of 'you're amazing', use 'you're the melody I didn't know I was searching for'"
    - "Replace 'sounds fun' with 'this honestly sounds fun! I love building things'"
    - "Make observations about their specific interests, not general compliments."
