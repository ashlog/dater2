[Mina, 25] [like] What if I told you that: I’ve read 70 books this year, but you can only ... | Let's debate this topic: Cornbread should not be sweet ! → Mina, that 35% rule is a serious data challenge – are we talking about 24 fully accessible books, or 24.5 with a cliffhanger? We might need a whiteboard and a coffee to figure out the protocol.
7. [Rhea, 27] [like] My simple pleasures: sunsets, Disney movies, spending time with fami... | My most irrational fear: shopping cart rolling and hitting a car → Rhea, I thought my biggest fear was forgetting my reusable bags, but you’re clearly operating on a whole other level of grocery store anxiety.

[Mackenzie, 24] [like] I'll fall for you if: you send me obscure Wikipedia articles | Give me travel tips for: where you are taking me next → Mackenzie, for our first trip, I was considering a deep space mission to analyze exotic plant life, but a local boba spot feels like a more grounded first stop. What are your initial coordinates?
17. [Agnes, 24] [like] The way to win me over is: Good food!! Spicy please | This year, I really want to: Take the ferry and hike angel island! New to sf... → Agnes, that’s a serious wine collection. Now, for the real test: which bottle pairs best with your Shin ramen, or should we go for spicy karaage?
18. [Elle, 29] [like] I'm weirdly attracted to: Glasses lol | I bet you can't: Just in general → I bet I can make you explain quantum mechanics using only garden gnome analogies. Want to test that theory over boba, Elle?
19. [Marissa, 25] [like] This year, I really want to: Start going after my fitness goals every day | My greatest strength: I’m a positive thinker → Marissa, if that positive thinking is your greatest strength, could you convince me burnt toast is delicious? We could test that theory over coffee.

32. [Megan, 26] [like] Green flags I look for: Will do the dishes after I cook us dinner | The dorkiest thing about me is: I country western line dance → Dorkiest? I spend my weekends optimizing code and debating pineapple on pizza. We should grab coffee and decide who wins the true nerd crown.

34. [Anna, 25] [like] Typical Sunday: Coffee in the park and plotting which dog to steal | I go crazy for: Ice cold Diet Coke → Anna, 'going crazy' for ice cold Diet Coke is a bold claim. We should test that theory with some spicy chicken karaage, and see if it holds up.

47. [Shelby, 26] [like] I hype myself up by: working out! | Together, we could: have deep convos about life → Shelby, my internal disco ball usually spins to 70s classics, so your Chris Brown take is intriguing. What's the one track you'd use to convert me over coffee?

52. [Chloe, 26] [like] This year, I really want to: Travel | I bet you can't: Touch your toes → Chloe, bragging rights are important. Does having a boat come with a special skill, or just endless waves of compliments from your friends? We could debate that over some boba.
53. [Maya, 25] [like] You should *not* go out with me if: you hate the warriors | Best travel story: I thought I got kidnapped → A story that starts with 'I thought I got kidnapped' requires an immediate debrief. How about you trade the details for a coffee?
